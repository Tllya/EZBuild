<h1>EZBuild</h1>

Release 1.0.0: https://github.com/mrmeep321/EZBuild/releases/tag/v1.0.0</h1>

EZBuild is a utility mod developed for OWML to simplify the process of creating and placing in-game objects and mechanics like buildings and trigger volumes.

The goal of EZBuild is to allow modders to easily develop their mechanics or objects within Unity itself, and import them into the game with minimal effort.

EZBuild is still in early stages of development, but in the end, I want this mod to become a gateway for new modders to dip their feet into the water and get into modding without having to slog through too much Unity's massive and complex API base.

If you find any bugs (i'm sure there are a lot. v1.0.0 was developed in around 7 hours) or have any suggestions for features, please either @ me in the modding discord (https://discord.gg/GZvCmcsK), my handle is @mrmeep321, or submit an issue request.

## Current functionality

Implement new custom objects into the game with Unity AssetBundles

Manage object hierarchies with these new objects

Manage object spatial position

Manage object planetary position to allow for efficient placement of buildings on planets.

Suppport for planets created with New Horizons


## Roadmap
Manage object rotation intuitively and relative to other bodies to simplify angular stuff

Inbuilt full angular and translational velocity/acceleration/position control

Interaction volume support for newly created objects to make interactable and pick-uppable objects

Animated characters and objects

Rebuilt physics support for mass/gravity relationships to be used for dynamic systems created with NewHorizons like binary stars
